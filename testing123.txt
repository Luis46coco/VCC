Testing 1, 2, 3!!  

I did a “git merge origin/msmcdoug” locally so, and it did update my VCC folder 
files. But the question is, am I now locally on msmcdoug branch? If I commit and 
push this file, will it show up on msmcdoug branch or my fork?

Ahh… ok, nope. Apparently it updated my forks VCC-1.200b branch w/ msmcdoug branch + this file.  

Git is NOT easy to learn (at first anyway!) I have been dreading learning it for years. 

Delete this file after some more testing.
