### My TODO – list of priorities. 
* Study the code and begin making some notes on it -- put the notes in *.md files 
* ~~Locate my last changes from 6/2016 and sync w/ this baseline.~~ 4/10/17 
* First thing is find and fix the aspect ratio. And make that the default. That thing bugs me to no end. 
* Then add some standard zooms line 1x 1.5x 2x ... (the 1x & 2x ... are ideal, because then they are pixel perfect)
* Next would be to refresh a ROM file and reset CPU when a file change occurs, for quick development of ROMs (also look at doing the same thing for DSK files (and .bin? files)
* Add a ToolBar, that is dockable, w/ the most frequent settings.  
* Look over the issues list on the VCC site.
